        <p>I declare that I wish Sullivan Upper School to treat all donations that I make from the date of this declaration and all donations made to the school in the four years prior to the date of this declaration until I notify you otherwise, as Gift Aid donations.</p>
        <p>I confirm I have paid or will pay an amount of UK Income Tax and/or UK Capital Gains Tax for each tax year (6 April to 5 April) that is at least equal to the amount of tax that all the charities or Community Amateur Sports Clubs (CASCs) that I donate to will reclaim on my gifts for that tax year.</p>
        <p style="font-size:90%;">If you pay Income Tax at the higher or additional rate and want to receive the additional tax relief due to you, you must include all your Gift Aid donations on your Self-Assessment tax return or ask HM Revenue and Customs to adjust your tax code.</p>
